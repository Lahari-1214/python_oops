SELF:
self is a default variable that contains the memory address of the instance of the current class

'''s1 = Student() : ‘s1’ contains the memory address of the instance. This memory address is 
internally and by default passed to ‘self’ variable. Since ‘self’ knows the memory address 
of the instance, it can refer to all the members of the instance'''

# we can use self in 2 ways:
1.The ‘self’ variable is used as first parameter in the constructor as: 
    def __init__(self): 

2.‘self’ can be used as first parameter in the instance methods as: 
    def talk(self):


CONSTRUCTURE:
A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize the instance variables of a class.
